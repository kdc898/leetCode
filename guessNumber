/**
 *We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 *I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

 *Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

 *You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

   * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
   * 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
   * 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

 *Return the number that I picked.
*/

 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
